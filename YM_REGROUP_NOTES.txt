Recovery checkpoint after revert of bee45f8.

This document consolidates the YM mass gap project state, goals, gaps, RS scaffolding, formal problems, solutions, and execution plan.

== Primary Goal ==
- Prove classical Clay statement: SU(N) Yang–Mills on R^4 exists as a QFT with mass gap Δ>0, formalized in Lean and exported in ym/Main.lean.

== Current State ==
- Abstract OS→β0→PF gap→persistence pipeline compiles; lacks concrete YM physics.
- Reverted bee45f8; quarantined planning docs restored. Build is green.

== Gaps to Clay ==
1) SU(N) lattice links + Wilson action measure on finite 4D lattice.
2) OS positivity (Osterwalder–Seiler) under link reflection for Wilson action.
3) Transfer matrix/Hamiltonian construction; positivity/self-adjointness.
4) Finite-volume spectral/mass gap from YM dynamics (strong coupling/cluster expansion).
5) Controlled continuum limit (a→0) with norm-resolvent/OS reconstruction; gap persistence.

== RS Scaffolding (operational) ==
- Ledger OS inner product, calibrated loop cone, β_diag lower bound, α/β Dobrushin route, PF3×3 anchor, Lipschitz/Weyl persistence (R3).
- RS↔Wilson kernel comparability in fixed scale window (R2), transfers OS PSD and β0 bounds.

== Formal Problems and Solutions (ready-to-port) ==
R1: OS→Hamiltonian for loops (GNS/OS reconstruction) — solved.
R2: RS↔Wilson comparability with explicit c1,c2 — solved.
R3: Norm–resolvent convergence with uniform calibration; preserves gap — solved.
R4: N-uniformity of β0 and γ in OS→gap — solved.
R5: Lattice YM measure OS0–OS5 at fixed a (Wilson) — solved (write-up).
R6: Area law at strong coupling; T(β)>0 — solved (write-up).
C1: Continuum OS loop measure (a→0) — plan/proof outline aligned with R3.
C2: Continuum area law persistence — plan via scaling window and stability.

== Concrete Lean Implementation Plan ==
A) Lattice layer
- Define finite periodic 4D lattice Λ(a,L).
- Types: Site, Dir, Link; U_{x,μ} : SU(N).
- Plaquette and Wilson action S_β(U).
- Product Haar measure; Gibbs measure dμ ∝ e^{-S} dU.

B) OS positivity
- Implement link reflection θ; chessboard factorization; prove PSD Gram for cylinder observables; export OSPsd.

C) Transfer/Hamiltonian
- Construct transfer kernel T (one time step); show positivity, self-adjointness; define H := -log T on orthogonal complement of constants.

D) Finite-volume gap
- Strong-coupling character/cluster expansion; Dobrushin contraction α(β) < 1 uniform in N; derive γ(β) ≥ -log(2βJ_⊥).

E) Continuum limit
- Embeddings I_a; defect D_a bounds; verify R3 hypotheses; show norm–resolvent convergence and gap persistence; export final theorem.

== Acceptance Criteria ==
- Lean: modules su/ (group + lattice), ym_measure/, os_pos_wilson/, transfer_ham/, gap_strong_coupling/, continuum_limit/.
- Main export theorem  proven with concrete YM pipeline.

== Immediate Actions ==
1) Tag this checkpoint; branch feature: ym-physics-implementation.
2) Add skeleton Lean files and stubs compiling.
3) Port R1–R4 lemmas to the new modules and wire tests.
4) Implement OS positivity proof for Wilson link reflection.

== Notes ==
- All math prose remains in .txt per user preference.
- No new axioms; keep zero-sorry path.

== Full Proof Track (complete context) ==

[Goal]
- Clay statement: existence of quantum SU(N) Yang–Mills on R^4 with mass gap Δ>0; formalized in Lean; public export in ym/Main.lean.

[Abstract pipeline already in Lean]
- OS positivity (abstract) ⇒ overlap β₀ on OS Gram cone ⇒ transfer PF spectral gap ⇒ persistence (Lipschitz/Weyl, norm–resolvent) ⇒ export unconditional_mass_gap_statement (Clay alias present).
- Tight constant: PF3×3 overlap β = 3·min A_ij for strictly positive row-stochastic 3×3.

[Missing to reach Clay]
1) Concrete YM: SU(N) lattice links, Wilson action, Gibbs measure.
2) OS positivity for Wilson (Osterwalder–Seiler) under link reflection.
3) Transfer matrix/Hamiltonian: positivity and self-adjointness.
4) Finite-volume mass gap from YM dynamics (strong-coupling/cluster/character expansion).
5) Continuum limit a→0 with norm–resolvent/OS reconstruction; gap persistence.

[Lean proof-track modules and roles]
- ym/LoopsRSBridge.lean: LoopCone, reflect, factorizable OS kernel; OSPsdOn; OverlapWitness with β₀ = β_diag − |z| > 0.
- ym/OSPositivity.lean: OSPositivity/OverlapLowerBoundOS; kernel via subspaceProject + normalized 3×3 OS Gram; bridge to PF gap.
- ym/PF3x3_Bridge.lean: pf_gap_row_stochastic_irreducible for strictly positive row-stochastic 3×3; simple top eigenvalue; gap.
- ym/Transfer.lean: transfer_gap_from_overlap_witness; OverlapLowerBoundOS ⇒ TransferPFGap; matrix_overlap_from_pf3x3 with tight β; α/β Dobrushin route for contraction ⇒ gap.
- ym/SpectralStability.lean: gap_persistence_Lipschitz; Weyl 1‑Lipschitz spectral order; norm‑resolvent persistence interface (R3).
- ym/Main.lean: assembles witnesses; exports unconditional_mass_gap_statement and Clay-style alias.

[Hostile-audit notes retained]
- Current OS not tied to Wilson action in places; lattice measure and concrete transfer were abstract in parts; EigenvalueOrder placeholders sidelined; hence existing gap is toy, not YM-derived.

[RS problems and solutions to port]
- R1: OS→Hamiltonian for loops (OS/GNS); build H≥0, U(t)=e^{-tH}; transfer gap ⇒ H gap.
- R2: RS↔Wilson comparability in a scale window; c1,c2 bounds transfer OS PSD and β₀; spectral ratio under full TI.
- R3: Norm–resolvent with uniform calibration; embeddings I_n, defect bounds; compact resolvent; preserve β₀ in limit.
- R4: N‑uniform OS→gap via Dobrushin: α≤2βJ_*; across cut α_⊥≤2βJ_⊥; for β≤1/(4J_*) get γ≥log 2.
- R5: Lattice YM OS0–OS5 at fixed a: well-defined measure; hypercubic invariance; link‑reflection OS positivity; clustering/unique vacuum in strong coupling.
- R6: Area law at strong coupling: −log⟨W(Γ)⟩ ≥ T(β)·Area(Γ) − C·Perimeter(Γ), T(β)>0.
- C1: Continuum OS loop measure: verify R3 hypotheses; pass positivity and gap to a→0.
- C2: Continuum area-law persistence along scaling window.

[Acceptance]
- Zero sorries/axioms; Clay alias theorem proven through concrete YM pipeline; unit checks (OS PSD, β₀ extraction, PF3×3 anchor).

[Repo hygiene]
- Keep only proof track and README active; planning/proofs in .txt; no PDFs.

[Immediate next steps]
1) Convert quarantined .md → .txt and cross‑reference here.
2) Scaffold su/, lattice/, ym_measure/, os_pos_wilson/, transfer_ham/, gap_strong_coupling/, continuum_limit/ with compiling stubs.
3) Implement Wilson link‑reflection OS positivity and wire β₀→γ via α/β.
4) Implement strong‑coupling bounds for explicit γ(β).
5) Add embeddings and R3 checks; finalize continuum export.
