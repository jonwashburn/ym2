## Recognition Science — Physical Answers (Overview)

Scope: Plain‑language summary of the physical reasons and answers behind the Recognition Science (RS) framework as presented in EMR‑c (treated as the literal architecture and measurement of reality). Each item names the claim, the physical reason, and the concrete answer/implication.

### 1) Why a ledger? Why positive cost?
- **Reason**: “Nothing cannot recognize itself” forbids a zero‑content world. Any distinction event must be posted to an account so the world remains auditable and finite.
- **Answer**: A positive, double‑entry ledger with immutable quantum δ is necessary. Each recognition is a debit/credit pair of magnitude δ; zero or negative creation would make the system trivial or divergent.

### 2) Why dual‑balance? Why least‑cost evolution?
- **Reason**: Without a balancing conjugate, positive costs would accumulate without bound; finiteness forces reversible bookkeeping and cancellation.
- **Answer**: Dual‑balance (debit/credit symmetry) and global cost minimization govern all allowed processes; nature follows least cost analogous to least action.

### 3) Why the unique cost functional J(x) = 1/2(x + 1/x) − 1?
- **Reason**: Symmetry (x ↔ 1/x), analyticity off 0, ledger‑finiteness (no superlinear blow‑up), and positivity at x≠1 eliminate all higher or logarithmic tails.
- **Answer**: The only compatible functional is J(x) = 1/2(x + 1/x) − 1, normalized by J(1)=0.

### 4) Why the golden ratio φ?
- **Reason**: Self‑similar recurrence x ↦ 1 + k/x with integer k expresses “split and rebalance”. Countability forces k ∈ ℕ; least cost picks k=1.
- **Answer**: Fixed point solves x = 1 + 1/x ⇒ φ = (1+√5)/2. φ controls damping/gaps and scaling.

### 5) Why exactly three spatial dimensions?
- **Reason**: Stable distinction requires nontrivial linking of dual cycles. In d=2 links can’t be independent; in d≥4 links untie (lower cost) so the penalty vanishes.
- **Answer**: d=3 is minimal and forced by the Hopf‑link penalty ΔJ = ln φ for one linking, which is positive and unavoidable in 3D but avoidable in ≥4D.

### 6) Why an eight‑tick temporal cycle?
- **Reason**: A complete minimal spatial recognition must visit each voxel vertex once; atomic ticks forbid concurrency.
- **Answer**: Hypercubic Hamiltonicity gives minimal period T = 2^D; with D=3 ⇒ 8 ticks.

### 7) Why a periodic cubic lattice background?
- **Reason**: Homogeneity, isotropy, and minimal description length pick periodic tilings. A cube is the simplest isotropic voxel that tiles space face‑to‑face.
- **Answer**: Use Z^3 as the canonical global background (postulate for global statements); local conclusions only need “some homogeneous, isotropic discrete manifold”.

### 8) What sets c, λ_rec, τ0, E_coh?
- **Reason**: c is the maximum hop rate (space/time conversion of the ledger). λ_rec balances recognition cost with curvature cost (Planck‑form bridge). τ0 is fixed by the eight‑tick scheduler. E_coh is the minimal positive energy quantum from φ‑constrained degrees of freedom.
- **Answer**:
  - c: universal maximum propagation speed (bridge identity c = λ_rec/τ0).
  - λ_rec = √(ħ G / c^3) (Planck length via bridge, non‑circular under units quotient).
  - τ0 = 2π / (8 ln φ) (tick in natural units; mapped by the bridge).
  - E_coh = φ^−5 (dimensionless at proof layer; mapped to eV by the bridge).

### 9) Why the Reality Bridge is non‑circular?
- **Reason**: Numbers attach only after quotienting out units; cost→action and tick→time commute with the units quotient.
- **Answer**: A strict monoidal functor B with units quotient Q and numeric landing Ã gives A = Ã∘Q and J = Ã∘B_*; dimensionless outputs are anchor‑invariant.

### 10) Why α emerges from seed–gap–curvature?
- **Reason**: The geometric seed (phase volume) is corrected by a universal self‑similar “undecidability” gap series (ln φ) and a curvature closure from the voxel’s seam geometry.
- **Answer**: α^−1 = 4π·11 − ln φ − 103/(102 π^5) = 137.03599908 (bridge‑level number, no knobs).

### 11) Why quantum statistics and the Born rule?
- **Reason**: The path measure e^{−C[γ]} with dual‑balance forces quadratic probability (factorization, phase‑invariance). Permutation symmetry of indistinguishables restricts to 1‑D irreps.
- **Answer**: P = |ψ|^2 (Born); only Bose (+) or Fermi (−) sectors are admissible.

### 12) Why the nine‑state alphabet, six registers, and 16 opcodes?
- **Reason**: Cost granularity and stability bound the ledger alphabet to {±4,…,0}. Minimal control of dual‑balanced dynamics across 3D plus timing yields six registers and the smallest closed reversible instruction set of 16.
- **Answer**: Deterministic, reversible, minimal instruction set consistent with atomic ticks and φ‑scaling.

### 13) Why ILG gravity and its cosmology hooks?
- **Reason**: Information‑bandwidth limits throttle long‑range field updates; the effective kernel w(k,a) modifies growth within universal bounds without new tunables.
- **Answer**: Predictive growth and rotation behavior; inflation with V(χ) ∝ tanh^2(χ/(√6 φ)) gives (n_s≈0.967, r≈1.3×10^−3, A_s≈2.1×10^−9).

### 14) Why parameter‑free baryogenesis and proton stability?
- **Reason**: The same ledger scalar and parity structure fix CP phase and wash‑out exponent; late‑time operator suppression protects the proton lifetime.
- **Answer**: η_B ≈ 5.1×10^−10 and τ_p ≳ 10^37 yr (consistent with data) without new tunables.

### 15) Why the predictions list is over‑constrained (falsifiable)?
- **Reason**: A single logical cascade fixes many unrelated sectors. Changing any one “correction” breaks matches elsewhere.
- **Answer**: Cross‑domain numerical closures (α, masses, cosmology, condensed matter) act as mutual audits; failures would falsify the architecture.

### 16) Why reproducibility is emphasized?
- **Reason**: The framework is a “measurement” with no fit knobs; reproducibility audits and immutable derivations are the scientific counterpart of an instrument spec.
- **Answer**: Pinned proofs, notebooks, and checksumed numerics; dimensionless claims remain the same under anchor changes.
