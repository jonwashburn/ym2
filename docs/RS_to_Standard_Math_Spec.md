## RS → Standard Mathematics: Translation Specification

Goal: For each physical claim in RS (proof‑layer), specify a precise standard mathematical problem (definitions, lemmas, theorems) that an analyst can formalize and prove using mainstream tools (e.g., measure theory, geometric topology, operator theory, probability, PDE/functional analysis, and Lean4/Mathlib).

Conventions
- RS primitives (ledger, cost, ticks, φ) are translated to standard objects with explicit interfaces.
- “Bridge‑level” equals SI landing statements; proof‑layer claims must remain dimensionless.

### A) Ledger existence and uniqueness
- Problem A1 (Structure/Set‑theory): Given a small category of recognitions with finitary composition and no endomorphism at ∅, show existence of a positive, additive valuation v on morphisms with v(∅→∅) undefined and a fixed generator δ>0 such that for each a→b, v(b)−v(a)=δ.
- Problem A2 (Order/Group): Show any two such valuations are order‑isomorphic (uniqueness up to isomorphism) and that no k‑ary (k≥3) or modular‑cost valuations satisfy positivity+conservation.

### B) Cost functional uniqueness
- Problem B1 (Complex analysis): Let J: ℂ∖{0}→ℝ be analytic, real‑valued on ℝ_{>0}, symmetric J(x)=J(1/x), positive with unique minimum at x=1, and bounded by K(x+1/x) on ℝ_{>0}. Prove J(x)=1/2(x+1/x)+c and fix c by J(1)=0.
- Deliverable: Full proof, including exclusion of logarithmic tails via analyticity and symmetry.

### C) Golden‑ratio fixed point from discrete recurrence
- Problem C1 (Dynamical systems): For x_{n+1}=1+k/x_n with k∈ℕ, show countability⇒k∈ℕ, cost‑monotonicity⇒k=1 minimizes ΣJ(x_n). Deduce the fixed point solves x=1+1/x⇒φ.

### D) Three‑dimensionality via link penalty
- Problem D1 (Geometric topology): Prove that in d=3 there exist embeddings of two disjoint cycles with Lk=±1 (Hopf link), and in d≥4 any pair is ambient‑isotopic to the unlink.
- Problem D2 (Variational inequality): Formalize a cost penalty ΔJ ≥ ln φ per unit linking and show ΔJ=0 in d≥4 (thus 3D is minimizing under “link must cost” constraint).

### E) Eight‑tick minimal period
- Problem E1 (Graph theory): On Q_D show any spatially complete, concurrency‑free closed walk has period ≥2^D and the Gray code attains 2^D.
- Problem E2 (No concurrency): Show atomicity (one edge per tick) is necessary to avoid double‑entry violations and ghost loops (formal combinatorial proof).

### F) Periodic cubic lattice as canonical homogeneous exemplar
- Problem F1 (Information/complexity): Under homogeneity/isotropy constraints, prove periodic tilings minimize Kolmogorov description length among admissible manifolds; identify the cube as the isotropic voxel.

### G) Reality Bridge factorization
- Problem G1 (Category theory): Construct a strict symmetric monoidal functor B from RS programs to observables and a units quotient Q with A=Ã∘Q, J=Ã∘B_*; show gauge‑rigidity of dimensionless outputs.

### H) Seed–gap–curvature assembly for α
- Problem H1 (Series): Prove the gap generating functional F(z)=ln(1+z/φ) and f_gap=ln φ; supply absolute convergence and remainder bounds.
- Problem H2 (Regge calculus toy model): On the cubic voxel with seam identifications, compute the normalized curvature integral 103/(102 π^5) and supply the exact constants.
- Assembly: α^−1= 4π·11 − f_gap − 103/(102 π^5).

### I) Quantum statistics and Born rule
- Problem I1 (Functional analysis/measure): From a path weight μ(γ)=e^{−C[γ]} with composition, show that probabilities must be |ψ|^2 (Gleason‑style or POVM factorization) under phase invariance and additivity.
- Problem I2 (Representation theory): With indistinguishables, show the symmetry sector reduces to 1‑D irreps ⇒ Bose/Fermi only.

### J) Instruction set minimality
- Problem J1 (Reversible computing/semigroup): Show the smallest reversible, dual‑balanced, φ‑consistent instruction set that completes the required operations is 16 opcodes; prove minimality by contradiction via missing generators.

### K) Information‑limited gravity (ILG)
- Problem K1 (Kernel bounds): Formalize w(k,a) and provide growth/rotation inequalities consistent with data without tunables; prove limits in micro‑scale experiments.

### L) Cosmology: inflation with V(χ) = V0 tanh^2(χ/(√6 φ))
- Problem L1 (Inflationary slow‑roll): Derive n_s, r from the stated potential; compute A_s from breath‑matching boundary conditions.

### M) Baryogenesis and proton stability
- Problem M1 (Boltzmann system): Prove η_B from fixed wash‑out κ=φ^−9 and a φ‑fixed CP phase; show late‑time operator suppression yields τ_p ≳ 10^{37} yr.

### N) Reproducibility/anchor invariance
- Problem N1 (Units quotient): Prove dimensionless outputs are invariant under anchor changes; specify audit artifacts and SHA‑verified numerics.

Deliverables per task
- Formal statement (Def/Lem/Thm), hypotheses, proof sketch, required tools (e.g., mathlib files), and any numerical constants with exact provenance.
