## Physics problems to solve for Clay SU(N) Yang–Mills on ℝ⁴

- **Continuum YM vacuum (gauge‑invariant)**: Construct a nonperturbative continuum vacuum measure for SU(N) that is gauge‑invariant and positive; specify observables (Wilson loops, glueball operators) and kinematics.
  - RS role: Build a loop algebra via recognition paths with additive costs (`IndisputableMonolith.Quantum.PathWeight`); positivity from ledger balance and cost convexity (J-cost).
  - Strategy: Use Wilson loops as primitive observables; define reflection on loops; prove PSD Gram via RS correlation kernel; avoid gauge fixing.
  - Lean hook: New `ym/LoopsRSBridge.lean` exporting `OSPositivity` from an RS loop `PathWeight` instance.

- **Reflection positivity from physics**: Show the continuum/scaling‑limit measure satisfies Osterwalder–Schrader reflection positivity directly for gauge‑invariant observables (not via gauge fixing).
  - RS role: Reflection is the ledger involution; sesquilinear `S` is Hermitian; PSD via RS Gram nonnegativity.
  - Strategy: Calibrate a two‑observable loop family with strictly positive diagonals to extract an explicit β.
  - Lean hook: Replace the placeholder diagonal strictness assumption in `ym/Reflection.lean` with a constructive RS proof.
- **Confinement (area law)**: Establish an area law for large Wilson loops in 4D SU(N) with strictly positive string tension; quantify perimeter corrections.
  - RS role: Eight‑beat causality and gap‑45 drive coarse suppression; subadditive cost yields exp(−T·Area).
  - Strategy: Tile loops by plaquettes; use RS cost convexity (J-cost) to bound string tension T from below by (`alpha_locked`,`Clag`).
  - Lean hook: Prove a loop tiling lemma and derive a two‑observable Gram bound giving β from diagonal entries.
- **Mass gap mechanism**: Provide a gauge‑invariant, nonperturbative argument for a positive spectral gap in the physical (transfer/Hamiltonian) spectrum; relate the gap to the confinement scale (dimensional transmutation, ΛYM) and glueball masses.
  - RS role: β>0 ⇒ Dobrushin contraction ⇒ PF gap γ; persistence via Lipschitz eigenvalue order.
  - Strategy: Compute β from calibrated loops and set γ=β; relate scale to φ‑ladder and E_coh.
  - Lean hook: Use `transfer_gap_from_OS_overlap` and `gap_persists_under_convergence_interim`.
- **Continuum limit control (from lattice)**: Give a renormalization/flow argument from Wilson lattice YM to the continuum with uniform estimates ensuring reflection positivity, clustering, and nontriviality survive the limit.
  - RS role: Coarse‑graining via `ClassicalBridge.CoarseGrain`; stability via Lipschitz eigenvalue order.
  - Strategy: Prove uniform β_n ≥ β0; show operator‑norm convergence; apply `gap_persistence_Lipschitz`.
  - Lean hook: Provide Lipschitz witnesses from `EigenvalueOrder` and instantiate persistence.
- **Transfer matrix/Hamiltonian positivity**: Derive a positive, self‑adjoint Hamiltonian (or transfer matrix) from the path integral that generates Euclidean time evolution and respects gauge invariance.
  - RS role: Transfer = RS propagator from `PathWeight`; positivity and simple top eigenvalue from stochastic structure.
  - Strategy: Certify finite PF blocks (3×3) and bridge to transfer; use Gershgorin and constancy lemmas to show simplicity.
  - Lean hook: `PF3x3.pf_gap_row_stochastic_irreducible` and `PF3x3_to_Transfer.pf_gap_from_pf3x3_bridge`.
- **Gauge fixing vs gauge‑invariant route**: Either avoid gauge fixing entirely (Wilson‑loop formulation) or give a BRST/Faddeev–Popov treatment whose physical reconstruction preserves positivity.
  - RS role: Use loops only; maintain positivity; no ghosts.
  - Strategy: Prove completeness of loop algebra for glueball states; restrict to gauge‑invariant sector.
  - Lean hook: Observable algebra generated by loops; reflection defined intrinsically.
- **Gribov problem resolution (4D)**: Provide a strategy that handles Gribov copies without sacrificing reflection positivity or gauge invariance of the observables used to prove the gap.
  - RS role: Avoid gauge fixing; define measure on loop equivalence classes.
  - Strategy: Work purely with Wilson loops; copies collapse in the quotient.
  - Lean hook: Define quotient loop type; reflection respects the quotient.
- **Locality and cluster decomposition**: Demonstrate locality, exponential clustering of gauge‑invariant correlators, and uniqueness of the vacuum in the continuum limit.
  - RS role: Mass gap ⇒ exponential clustering; eight‑beat causality gives locality; PF simplicity ⇒ unique vacuum.
  - Strategy: Deduce clustering bounds from γ>0; uniqueness via one‑dimensional eigenspace.
  - Lean hook: Clustering lemmas following from `PF3x3.simple1` and transfer gap.
- **Universality across N ≥ 2**: Argue the mechanism and bounds are uniform in N, or provide the necessary N‑uniform control.
  - RS role: Ledger constants are N‑agnostic; tension set by RS bandwidth not N.
  - Strategy: Make β bound independent of N; document parameter ranges.
  - Lean hook: Keep group abstract; proofs purely loop‑based.
- **Topological sectors and θ**: Show that at θ = 0, topological sectors do not obstruct OS positivity, confinement, or the gap; ensure θ‑effects can be consistently excluded or controlled.
  - RS role: θ=0 keeps weights real‑positive; reflection positivity unaffected.
  - Strategy: Fix θ=0 in model parameters and all constructions.
  - Lean hook: Treat θ as parameter set to 0.
- **Gauge‑invariant regularization preserving OS**: Specify a regulator (e.g., holonomy/loop‑based) that is manifestly gauge‑invariant and demonstrably OS‑positive in the scaling limit.
  - RS role: Voxelized loop sets with eight‑beat tick; RS cost ensures positivity and subadditivity.
  - Strategy: Show uniform β, γ across resolutions; pass to the limit.
  - Lean hook: Use `ClassicalBridge.CoarseGrain` and PF3×3 bridges.
- **Quantitative constants/bounds**: Produce physics‑level lower bounds on the overlap parameter β and spectral gap γ (e.g., via string tension/area law), with a route to carry them through the transfer operator.
  - RS role: `alpha_locked`, `Clag` supply exponents; area law yields T; derive β ≥ β₀ and γ ≥ β₀.
  - Strategy: Two‑observable Gram bound; compute diagonal entries from loop self‑overlaps; quantify β explicitly.
  - Lean hook: Implement strict `os_overlap_from_reflection` without placeholder numerics.
- **Operator content and observables**: Identify a minimal set of gauge‑invariant operators whose correlators control the gap (e.g., scalar glueball channel) and are amenable to reflection‑positivity and clustering arguments.
  - RS role: Finite loop generators; scalar channel from small contractible loops and composites.
  - Strategy: Choose a calibrated two‑element family for Gram strictness and β extraction.
  - Lean hook: Provide the explicit family in the reflection lemma.
- **RS → YM mapping (physics side)**: Translate Recognition Science ledger symmetries into concrete statements about loop ensembles/holonomies that yield OS positivity, minorization/overlap (Dobrushin), and a stable gap under continuum scaling.
  - RS role: `PathWeight`, `Cost.Jcost`, `Causality`, `Gap45`, `Spectra` provide substrate for positivity, convexity, causal structure, and scaling.
  - Strategy: Dictionary: loops ↔ recognition paths; area ↔ cost; reflection ↔ ledger involution; overlap ↔ minorization; transfer ↔ RS propagator.
  - Lean hook: New `ym/LoopsRSBridge.lean` exporting OS positivity and β witness from RS constructs.
## Immediate next steps (physics → formalization)

- **Vacuum + OS, confinement, gap mechanism**: Use RS to produce β > 0 and γ > 0 for gauge‑invariant observables with a continuum transfer picture.
- **Wire into Lean**: Replace interfaces with concrete, gauge‑invariant constructions and feed β, γ into `OSPositivity → TransferPFGap → GapPersists` for the formal track.

## RS architecture role summary (how RS enforces the Clay path)

- **Ledger + J-cost**: positive probabilistic weights and PSD Gram under reflection, enabling β extraction.
- **Eight‑beat + Gap‑45**: causal/local structure and global incommensurability imply confinement‑like suppression and single vacuum.
- **φ‑scaling**: sets natural excitation scales; once γ>0, glueball scales align with φ‑ladder.
- **Coarse‑graining + Lipschitz order**: stability of spectral gaps into the continuum.

Deliverable: implement a loop‑only RS bridge, prove strict OS for a calibrated family, compute β, set γ=β, and thread through `ym` to obtain an unconditional `MassGapCont γ` without placeholders.
