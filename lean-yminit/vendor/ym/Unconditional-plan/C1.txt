Two options:

Option A:

\[
\textbf{Setting.}
\]
Fix a dimension $d\ge 2$ and a hypercubic lattice $\varepsilon\mathbb{Z}^d$ with spacing $\varepsilon\in(0,\varepsilon_0]$. 
For a nearest–neighbour lattice loop $\Lambda\subset \varepsilon\mathbb{Z}^d$ let
\[
A_\varepsilon^{\min}(\Lambda)\in\mathbb{N}
\quad\text{be the minimal number of plaquettes in any lattice surface spanning }\Lambda,
\]
and let $P_\varepsilon(\Lambda)\in\mathbb{N}$ be the number of lattice edges on $\Lambda$ (its lattice perimeter).
Set the corresponding \emph{physical} area and perimeter
\[
\mathsf{Area}_\varepsilon(\Lambda):=\varepsilon^2 A_\varepsilon^{\min}(\Lambda),\qquad 
\mathsf{Per}_\varepsilon(\Lambda):=\varepsilon P_\varepsilon(\Lambda).
\]
For a continuum rectifiable closed curve $\Gamma\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ let $\mathsf{Area}(\Gamma)$ denote the least Euclidean area of any (Lipschitz) spanning surface with boundary $\Gamma$, and let $\mathsf{Per}(\Gamma)$ be its Euclidean length.


\[
\textbf{Uniform lattice area law (input; strong coupling).}
\]
Assume there exist functions $\tau_\varepsilon>0$ and $\kappa_\varepsilon\ge 0$, defined for $\varepsilon\in (0,\varepsilon_0]$, and constants
\[
T_*:=\inf_{0<\varepsilon\le\varepsilon_0}\frac{\tau_\varepsilon}{\varepsilon^2}>0,
\qquad
C_*:=\sup_{0<\varepsilon\le\varepsilon_0}\frac{\kappa_\varepsilon}{\varepsilon}<\infty,
\]
such that for all sufficiently large lattice loops $\Lambda\subset\varepsilon\mathbb{Z}^d$ (size measured in lattice units, which will automatically hold for fixed physical loops as $\varepsilon\downarrow 0$),
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lattice-area-law}
-\log\langle W(\Lambda)\rangle \;\ge\; \tau_\varepsilon\,A_\varepsilon^{\min}(\Lambda)\;-\;\kappa_\varepsilon\,P_\varepsilon(\Lambda)
\;=\;\Big(\tfrac{\tau_\varepsilon}{\varepsilon^2}\Big)\mathsf{Area}_\varepsilon(\Lambda)\;-\;\Big(\tfrac{\kappa_\varepsilon}{\varepsilon}\Big)\mathsf{Per}_\varepsilon(\Lambda).
\end{equation}
(Equation \eqref{eq:lattice-area-law} follows from the character expansion in the strong–coupling regime: writing the Wilson weight in irreducible characters, the activity ratio $\rho(\beta)$ for nontrivial representations obeys $\mu\cdot \rho(\beta) < 1$ for all sufficiently small $\beta$, with a lattice constant $\mu$, yielding $T(\beta):= -\log \rho(\beta) > 0$ and a perimeter correction controlled by $\kappa_\varepsilon$.)


\[
\textbf{Directed embeddings of loops.}
\]
Let $\Gamma\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ be a fixed rectifiable closed curve. 
A \emph{directed family} $\{\Gamma_\varepsilon\}_{\varepsilon\downarrow 0}$ of lattice loops converging to $\Gamma$ means:
(i) $\Gamma_\varepsilon\subset\varepsilon\mathbb{Z}^d$ is a nearest–neighbour loop,
(ii) the Hausdorff distance $d_H(\Gamma_\varepsilon,\Gamma)\to 0$ as $\varepsilon\downarrow 0$,
(iii) each $\Gamma_\varepsilon$ is contained in a tubular neighbourhood of $\Gamma$ of radius $O(\varepsilon)$ and follows the orientation of $\Gamma$ (e.g., via grid–snapping of a $C^1$ parametrization).


\[
\textbf{Two geometric facts.}
\]
\emph{Fact A (surface convergence).} For any directed family $\{\Gamma_\varepsilon\to\Gamma\}$,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:area-conv}
\lim_{\varepsilon\downarrow 0}\mathsf{Area}_\varepsilon(\Gamma_\varepsilon)\;=\;\mathsf{Area}(\Gamma).
\end{equation}
\emph{Sketch.} Because lattice surfaces are a subclass of Lipschitz surfaces, 
$\mathsf{Area}_\varepsilon(\Gamma_\varepsilon)\ge \mathsf{Area}^{\text{cont}}(\Gamma_\varepsilon)$, where the latter is the continuum minimal area for the boundary $\Gamma_\varepsilon$; lower semicontinuity of the Plateau problem under boundary convergence yields
$\liminf_{\varepsilon\downarrow 0}\mathsf{Area}^{\text{cont}}(\Gamma_\varepsilon)\ge \mathsf{Area}(\Gamma)$.
For the matching upper bound, approximate a continuum minimizer for $\Gamma$ by a cubical (axis–aligned) polyhedral surface with mesh $o(1)$ lying on $\varepsilon\mathbb{Z}^d$ and having boundary $\Gamma_\varepsilon$; its area exceeds $\mathsf{Area}(\Gamma)$ by $o(1)$, hence $\limsup_{\varepsilon\downarrow 0}\mathsf{Area}_\varepsilon(\Gamma_\varepsilon)\le \mathsf{Area}(\Gamma)$.
Combining the two inequalities gives \eqref{eq:area-conv}.


\emph{Fact B (perimeter control).} There exists a universal constant $\kappa_d:=\sup_{u\in\mathbb{S}^{d-1}}\sum_{i=1}^d |u_i|=\sqrt{d}$ such that for any directed family,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:per-bound}
\limsup_{\varepsilon\downarrow 0}\mathsf{Per}_\varepsilon(\Gamma_\varepsilon)\;\le\;\kappa_d\,\mathsf{Per}(\Gamma).
\end{equation}
\emph{Sketch.} On each sufficiently short segment of $\Gamma$ with unit tangent $u$, the nearest–neighbour routing on the lattice uses approximately $|u_1|, \dots, |u_d|$ fractions of steps along the coordinate directions. The local lattice length density is $\sum_i |u_i|$, which by Cauchy–Schwarz is at most $\sqrt{d}$. Integrating along $\Gamma$ and passing to the limit yields \eqref{eq:per-bound}. For planar loops (the usual Wilson–loop case embedded in a 2D plane), one may take $\kappa_d=\sqrt{2}$.


\[
\textbf{Main statement (continuum area law with perimeter term).}
\]
\textbf{Theorem.} 
Let $\Gamma\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ be a rectifiable closed curve with $\mathsf{Area}(\Gamma)<\infty$. 
Assume the uniform lattice bound \eqref{eq:lattice-area-law} on the scaling window $(0,\varepsilon_0]$.
Define the \emph{ε–independent} constants
\[
T\;:=\;\inf_{0<\varepsilon\le\varepsilon_0}\frac{\tau_\varepsilon}{\varepsilon^2}\;>\;0,
\qquad
C_0\;:=\;\sup_{0<\varepsilon\le\varepsilon_0}\frac{\kappa_\varepsilon}{\varepsilon}\;<\;\infty,
\qquad
C\;:=\;\kappa_d\,C_0,
\]
with $\kappa_d=\sqrt{d}$ (and in particular $\kappa_2=\sqrt{2}$ for planar loops).
Then for any directed family $\{\Gamma_\varepsilon\to\Gamma\}$,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:continuum-bound}
\limsup_{\varepsilon\downarrow 0}\bigl[-\log\langle W(\Gamma_\varepsilon)\rangle\bigr]
\;\ge\;
T\,\mathsf{Area}(\Gamma)\;-\;C\,\mathsf{Per}(\Gamma).
\end{equation}
In particular, the continuum string tension is positive and bounded below by $T$.


\emph{Proof.}
Starting from \eqref{eq:lattice-area-law} with $\Lambda=\Gamma_\varepsilon$,
\[
-\log\langle W(\Gamma_\varepsilon)\rangle
\;\ge\;
\Big(\tfrac{\tau_\varepsilon}{\varepsilon^2}\Big)\mathsf{Area}_\varepsilon(\Gamma_\varepsilon)
\;-\;
\Big(\tfrac{\kappa_\varepsilon}{\varepsilon}\Big)\mathsf{Per}_\varepsilon(\Gamma_\varepsilon).
\]
Taking $\limsup_{\varepsilon\downarrow 0}$ on both sides and using $\limsup(a_\varepsilon-b_\varepsilon)\ge
(\inf a_\varepsilon) - (\sup b_\varepsilon)$ in the form
\[
\limsup_{\varepsilon\downarrow 0}\bigl[A_\varepsilon-B_\varepsilon\bigr]
\;\ge\;
\Big(\inf_{0<\varepsilon\le\varepsilon_0}\tfrac{\tau_\varepsilon}{\varepsilon^2}\Big)\cdot
\liminf_{\varepsilon\downarrow 0}\mathsf{Area}_\varepsilon(\Gamma_\varepsilon)
\;-\;
\Big(\sup_{0<\varepsilon\le\varepsilon_0}\tfrac{\kappa_\varepsilon}{\varepsilon}\Big)\cdot
\limsup_{\varepsilon\downarrow 0}\mathsf{Per}_\varepsilon(\Gamma_\varepsilon),
\]
and then applying Facts A and B, we obtain
\[
\limsup_{\varepsilon\downarrow 0}\bigl[-\log\langle W(\Gamma_\varepsilon)\rangle\bigr]
\;\ge\;
T\,\mathsf{Area}(\Gamma)\;-\;C_0\cdot \kappa_d\,\mathsf{Per}(\Gamma)
\;=\;T\,\mathsf{Area}(\Gamma)\;-\;C\,\mathsf{Per}(\Gamma),
\]
which is \eqref{eq:continuum-bound}. \qed


\[
\textbf{Remarks.}
\]
1. The constants $T$ and $C$ are completely $\varepsilon$–independent and explicit in terms of the scaling–window bounds: $T$ is the uniform lower bound on the lattice string tension in \emph{physical} units ($\tau_\varepsilon/\varepsilon^2$), while $C$ is the product of the uniform perimeter coefficient in physical units ($C_0=\sup\kappa_\varepsilon/\varepsilon$) with the sharp geometric factor $\kappa_d=\sqrt{d}$ coming from grid routing. For planar Wilson loops, $C=\sqrt{2}\,C_0$.


2. The “large loop’’ qualifier is automatically satisfied in this setup: for any fixed physical loop $\Gamma$, the lattice representative $\Gamma_\varepsilon$ has diameter of order $\varepsilon^{-1}$ in lattice units, so the hypotheses behind \eqref{eq:lattice-area-law} (derived from strong–coupling/cluster or other constructive bounds) apply for all sufficiently small $\varepsilon$.


3. The bound \eqref{eq:continuum-bound} is exactly the statement that the continuum string tension $\sigma_{\text{cont}}:=\liminf_{\varepsilon\downarrow 0}\tau_\varepsilon/\varepsilon^2$ is positive (indeed $\sigma_{\text{cont}}\ge T>0$), with a controlled perimeter subtraction that is uniform along any directed family $\Gamma_\varepsilon\to\Gamma$.

Option B


This document outlines the rigorous mathematical procedure for constructing a continuum Quantum Field Theory (QFT) in four dimensions, starting from a family of lattice gauge theories, based on the provided assumptions. The goal is to show the existence of a continuum measure μ satisfying the Osterwalder-Schrader (OS) axioms, which in turn guarantees a physical theory with a positive Hamiltonian.
1. Existence of the Continuum Limit Measure μ
The first step is to establish the existence of a probability measure μ on loop configurations over R4 as the limit of the lattice measures μϵ​ when the lattice spacing ϵ→0.
A. Tightness and Weak Convergence
We are given tightness of the loop observables WΓ,ϵ​. In the context of probability measures, tightness implies relative compactness in the weak topology.
Theorem (Prokhorov): The assumption of tightness guarantees that there exists at least one subsequence ϵk​→0 such that the measures μϵk​​ converge weakly to a limit probability measure μ.
B. Convergence of Finite-Dimensional Distributions (Acceptance Criteria)
To characterize the theory, we must establish the convergence of the correlation functions (Schwinger functions). For any finite collection of loops Γ1​,…,Γn​:
Sn​(Γ1​,…,Γn​)=limϵ→0​⟨WΓ1​,ϵ​⋯WΓn​,ϵ​⟩μϵ​​
The existence of this limit relies critically on the "uniform locality/clustering bounds independent of ϵ". These bounds provide the analytical control necessary to perform the renormalization required to take the continuum limit and ensure the limit is well-defined. Assuming this convergence is established, the resulting Schwinger functions {Sn​} define the continuum measure μ.
2. Verification of the Osterwalder-Schrader Axioms (OS0–OS5)
The core of the construction is proving that the continuum measure μ satisfies the OS axioms.
OS0: Regularity (Temperedness)
The measure μ must be sufficiently regular, typically meaning the Schwinger functions satisfy polynomial bounds. This ensures the fields are tempered distributions. This follows from the uniform locality bounds assumed, which control the growth of correlations.
OS1: Euclidean Invariance
The measure μ must be invariant under the full Euclidean group (rotations and translations) of R4. The lattice regularization breaks continuous rotational symmetry. This symmetry must be restored in the limit ϵ→0. This requires proving that the limiting procedure (renormalization) results in rotationally covariant Schwinger functions.
OS2: Reflection Positivity (Preservation of OS Positivity) (Acceptance Criteria)
This axiom is essential for unitarity. Let A+​ be the algebra of observables localized in the positive-time half-space, and let Θ be the time reflection operator. We must show ⟨Θ(A)A⟩μ​≥0 for all A∈A+​.
Proof Sketch: We are given that the lattice measures μϵ​ are OS-positive. Since positivity is defined by an inequality, it is preserved under the limit. If A is approximated by lattice observables Aϵ​:
⟨Θ(A)A⟩μ​=limϵ→0​⟨Θ(Aϵ​)Aϵ​⟩μϵ​​≥0
The convergence is guaranteed by the convergence of finite-dimensional distributions.
OS3: Clustering (Unique Vacuum) (Acceptance Criteria)
The theory must exhibit decay of correlations:
lim∣x∣→∞​⟨ABx​⟩μ​=⟨A⟩μ​⟨B⟩μ​
where Bx​ is the translation of observable B by x.
This follows directly from the assumption of "uniform clustering bounds independent of ϵ," which ensures the decay property carries over to the continuum limit. Clustering guarantees the uniqueness of the vacuum state.
OS4/OS5: Symmetry and other technical conditions
Symmetry (bosonic statistics) is satisfied as the Wilson loop observables commute.
3. Hamiltonian Reconstruction (Acceptance Criteria)
Once OS0–OS5 are verified, the Osterwalder-Schrader Reconstruction Theorem guarantees the existence of a corresponding physical QFT.
A. Construction of the Hilbert Space H
The physical Hilbert space H is constructed by defining a sesquilinear form on the space of positive-time observables A+​ using Reflection Positivity (OS2):
⟨A,B⟩H​=⟨Θ(A)B⟩μ​
H is the completion of the quotient space A+​/N, where N is the subspace of null vectors. The inner product on H is positive definite.
B. Construction and Positivity of the Hamiltonian H
Euclidean time translations T(t) induce a semigroup of operators on H. Reflection Positivity (OS2) ensures that this is a strongly continuous contraction semigroup P(t) for t≥0 (i.e., ∥P(t)∥≤1).
Theorem (Hille-Yosida): There exists a unique self-adjoint generator H, the Hamiltonian, such that P(t)=e−tH.
Positivity (H ≥ 0): Because P(t) is a contraction semigroup for t≥0, the spectrum of its generator H must be non-negative. Thus, the reconstructed Hamiltonian is well-defined and satisfies H≥0.
The clustering property (OS3) ensures the existence of a unique vacuum state Ω∈H such that HΩ=0.
