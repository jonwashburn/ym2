## Challenge 1 — Cost Functional Uniqueness (Solution)

Claim. Let J: ℂ∖{0} → ℂ be analytic, real‑valued on ℝ_{>0}, symmetric under inversion J(z)=J(1/z), and (on ℝ_{>0}) non‑negative with a unique minimizer at x=1. Assume moreover that for some K>0,
\[
J(x)\;\le\;K\Bigl(x+\frac1x\Bigr)\qquad(x>0).
\]
Then, after ruling out higher harmonics (higher terms) and any non‑analytic artifacts (logarithmic tails), one must have
\[
\boxed{\,J(x)=\tfrac12\Bigl(x+\tfrac1x\Bigr)-1\,}
\]
in the canonical normalization where the minimizer has unit curvature; for this J the sharp growth constant is \(\boxed{K=\tfrac12}\).

Proof

1) Laurent symmetry (no logarithmic tails).
Because J is analytic on the punctured plane with the only singularity (if any) at 0, it has a global Laurent expansion
\[
J(z)=\sum_{n\in\mathbb Z} c_n z^n,\qquad 0<|z|<\infty.
\]
The inversion symmetry J(z)=J(1/z) forces c_n=c_{-n} for every n. Hence
\[
J(z)=c_0+\sum_{n\ge1} c_n\,(z^n+z^{-n}).\tag{1}
\]
Since J(x)∈ℝ for all x>0 and each z^n+z^{−n} is real on x>0, all coefficients c_n in (1) are real. (No logarithmic terms can appear in an analytic Laurent expansion, so “logarithmic tails” are excluded by analyticity.)

2) Pass to logarithmic coordinate and identify harmonics.
Write x=e^{u} with u∈ℝ. Then z^n+z^{−n}=e^{nu}+e^{−nu}=2\cosh(nu). Define
\[
F(u):=J(e^{u})=c_0+2\sum_{n\ge1} c_n \cosh(nu).\tag{2}
\]
Thus F is a real‑analytic, even function of u.

3) Eliminate all higher harmonics n≥2.
The growth bound becomes, for all u∈ℝ,
\[
F(u)\le 2K\cosh u.\tag{3}
\]
Suppose some c_m\ne0 with m≥2, and let m be maximal with that property. From (2),
\[
F(u)=2c_m\cosh(mu)+O(\cosh((m-1)u)).
\]
As u→+∞, \(\cosh(mu)/\cosh u\sim \tfrac12 e^{(m-1)u}\to\infty\). If c_m>0, (3) is violated for large u. If c_m<0, then F(u)→−∞ as u→+∞, contradicting the positivity of J on ℝ_{>0}. Hence c_n=0 for all n≥2.

Therefore,
\[
J(z)=c_0+c_1\,(z+z^{−1}).\tag{4}
\]

4) Impose positivity and the unique minimizer at x=1.
Restrict (4) to x>0:
\[
J(x)=c_1\Bigl(x+\frac1x\Bigr)+c_0.
\]
Then
\[
J'(x)=c_1\Bigl(1-\frac1{x^2}\Bigr),\qquad J''(x)=\frac{2c_1}{x^3}.
\]
Thus x=1 is the unique critical point, and it is a strict minimum iff c_1>0. Positivity with a unique minimizer at x=1 (i.e., J(x)≥0 and J(x)=0 only at x=1) forces
\[
0=J(1)=2c_1+c_0\quad\Rightarrow\quad c_0=-2c_1,
\]
so
\[
J(x)=c_1\Bigl(x+\frac1x-2\Bigr).\tag{5}
\]

5) Sharp growth constant K and canonical normalization.
From (5),
\[
\frac{J(x)}{x+1/x}=c_1\Bigl(1-\frac{2}{x+1/x}\Bigr)\uparrow c_1\quad\text{as }x\to\infty.
\]
Hence the least K for which J(x)≤K(x+1/x) (x>0) holds is
\[
K_{\min}=c_1.\tag{6}
\]
Near the minimizer, J''(1)=2c_1. The natural unit choice is to fix the curvature at the minimizer to one, J''(1)=1, which (equivalently by (6)) sets c_1=1/2. Substituting c_1=1/2 into (5) yields
\[
J(x)=\tfrac12\Bigl(x+\tfrac1x\Bigr)-1,
\]
and, by (6), the sharp growth constant for this J is precisely \(K=K_{\min}=\tfrac12\).

Remarks.
- The argument above “excludes higher terms” by showing c_n=0 for all n≥2 (they would either violate the upper bound or positivity).
- “Logarithmic tails” cannot arise because J is analytic (single‑valued) on ℂ∖{0}; only Laurent powers appear.
- The hypotheses determine the shape uniquely up to a positive scale c_1; fixing the natural normalization J''(1)=1 (equivalently, taking the optimal growth constant K as the coefficient) yields the stated explicit formula with K=1/2.
