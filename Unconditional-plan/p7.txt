This response provides a proof of Property P7 (Weyl's inequalities), demonstrating the 1-Lipschitz continuity of eigenvalues for self-adjoint operators, and then instantiates the concept of gap_persistence_Lipschitz.
P7: Proof of 1-Lipschitz Continuity of Eigenvalues (Weyl's Inequalities)
Context: Let V be a finite-dimensional inner-product space of dimension n. Let S(V) be the space of self-adjoint operators on V, equipped with the operator norm ∥⋅∥. For A∈S(V), we order the eigenvalues descendingly: λ1​(A)≥λ2​(A)≥⋯≥λn​(A).
Theorem (P7): For any A,B∈S(V), and for any k∈{1,…,n} (specifically k=1,2):
$$ |\lambda_k(A) - \lambda_k(B)| \leq |A - B| $$
Proof:
The proof relies on the Courant-Fischer Min-Max Theorem, which characterizes the k-th eigenvalue:
$$ \lambda_k(A) = \max_{\dim(S)=k} \min_{x \in S, |x|=1} \langle x, Ax \rangle $$
where S ranges over k-dimensional subspaces of V.
Let H=B−A. Since A and B are self-adjoint, H is self-adjoint, and B=A+H.
For any unit vector x (∥x∥=1), the Rayleigh quotient is bounded by the operator norm of H:
$$ \langle x, Hx \rangle \leq |H| $$
We apply the Min-Max theorem to B:
\begin{align*} \lambda_k(B) &= \max_{\dim(S)=k} \min_{x \in S, |x|=1} \langle x, (A+H)x \rangle \ &= \max_{\dim(S)=k} \min_{x \in S, |x|=1} (\langle x, Ax \rangle + \langle x, Hx \rangle) \end{align*}
Using the bound ⟨x,Hx⟩≤∥H∥:
\begin{align*} \lambda_k(B) &\leq \max_{\dim(S)=k} \min_{x \in S, |x|=1} (\langle x, Ax \rangle + |H|) \end{align*}
Since ∥H∥ is a constant, it can be pulled out of the minimization and maximization:
\begin{align*} \lambda_k(B) &\leq \left( \max_{\dim(S)=k} \min_{x \in S, |x|=1} \langle x, Ax \rangle \right) + |H| \end{align*}
The term in the parentheses is λk​(A) by the Min-Max theorem. Thus:
$$ \lambda_k(B) \leq \lambda_k(A) + |H| $$
$$ \lambda_k(B) - \lambda_k(A) \leq |B - A| $$
By symmetry, we can interchange the roles of A and B. Since ∥A−B∥=∥B−A∥, we similarly obtain:
$$ \lambda_k(A) - \lambda_k(B) \leq |A - B| $$
Combining these two inequalities yields the desired result:
$$ |\lambda_k(A) - \lambda_k(B)| \leq |A - B| $$
This proves that λ1​ and λ2​ are 1-Lipschitz continuous with respect to the operator norm.

Instantiation of gap_persistence_Lipschitz
The 1-Lipschitz continuity of the eigenvalues (P7) ensures the stability of the spectrum. We instantiate gap_persistence_Lipschitz by analyzing how this stability guarantees the persistence of the spectral gap. This instantiation requires no assumptions beyond the established context (finite-dimensional, self-adjoint operators).
1. Lipschitz Continuity of Eigenvalues:
The fundamental result established is:
∣λ1​(A)−λ1​(B)∣≤1⋅∥A−B∥
∣λ2​(A)−λ2​(B)∣≤1⋅∥A−B∥
2. Lipschitz Continuity of the Spectral Gap:
We define the spectral gap between the first two eigenvalues as g(A)=λ1​(A)−λ2​(A). We analyze the Lipschitz continuity of the gap function g(⋅).
\begin{align*} |g(A) - g(B)| &= |(\lambda_1(A) - \lambda_2(A)) - (\lambda_1(B) - \lambda_2(B))| \ &= |(\lambda_1(A) - \lambda_1(B)) + (\lambda_2(B) - \lambda_2(A))| \end{align*}
Using the triangle inequality:
$$ |g(A) - g(B)| \leq |\lambda_1(A) - \lambda_1(B)| + |\lambda_2(B) - \lambda_2(A)| $$
Applying the 1-Lipschitz property (P7):
$$ |g(A) - g(B)| \leq |A - B| + |A - B| = 2|A - B| $$
Instantiation Result:
The property gap_persistence_Lipschitz is instantiated as the theorem that the spectral gap function g(A) is 2-Lipschitz continuous with respect to the operator norm.
3. Persistence Condition:
This Lipschitz continuity implies that if A has a gap (g(A)>0), the gap persists under small perturbations. Specifically, we can lower bound the perturbed gap g(B):
g(B)≥g(A)−2∥A−B∥
The gap remains open (g(B)>0) provided that ∥A−B∥<g(A)/2.
